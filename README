Compute MD5 or SHA1 checksum of entire file or range of lines.
Store checksum in buffer variable or in user-specified
register.  Uses external programs to compute checksums;
currently supports GNU md5sum, GNU sha1sum, and OpenSSL.
If you are a Windows user, you should install GNU CoreUtils
for Windows
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/coreutils.php)
or Win32 OpenSSL
(http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

Usage:
:{range}Md5 [register] - displays MD5 checksum for given range
of lines (default is entire file) and stores in b:md5sum and
the register named as an argument.
:{range}Sha1 [register] - displays SHA1 checksum for given
range of lines (default is entire file) and stores in
b:sha1sum and the register named as an argument.
<Leader>md - displays MD5 checksum for entire file or visual
selection and stores in b:md5sum
<Leader>sh - displays SHA1 checksum for entire file or visual
selection and stores in b:sha1sum
